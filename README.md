# This is the Bla-bla generator.

The app will generate a nonsense bla-bla text for you, which you can save for later and load back the next time you need it.

User interface:
![UI](bla_bla_ui.png)

The window consists of four elements:
* Main editable text window - a generated text appears here. The text can be copied to the clipboard for further use;
* "Generate" button - automatically clears the text window and generates new text; 
* "Number of sentences" textbox - defines how long the text will be;
* "Clear" button - removes all text from the text window;
* "Save" button - saves the text from the text windows to the local database;
* "Load" button - loads text from the local database into the text window;
* "Export" button - exports the text to a text file "bla-bla.txt";
* "Import" button - imports text from the "bla-bla.txt" and puts it into text window.

Definitely need further development :)
